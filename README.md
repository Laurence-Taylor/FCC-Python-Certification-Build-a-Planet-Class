    The Planet class should have an __init__ method that:
        Has four parameters: self, name, planet_type, and star.
        Raises a TypeError with the message name, planet type, and star must be strings if any of the arguments passed in is not a string type.
        Raises a ValueError with the message name, planet_type, and star must be non-empty strings if any of the arguments passed in is an empty string.
        Assigns the values passed in to the instance attributes name, planet_type, and star.
    The Planet class should have an orbit method that returns a string in the format {name} is orbiting around {star}....
    The Planet class should have a __str__ method that returns a string in the format Planet: {name} | Type: {planet_type} | Star: {star}.
    You should create three instances of the Planet class named planet_1, planet_2, and planet_3.
    You should print each planet object to see the __str__ method output.
    You should call the orbit method on each planet object and print the result.
